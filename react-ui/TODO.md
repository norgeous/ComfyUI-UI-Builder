- revise sidebar layout (full height with scroll section)

## Next

  - using multiple instances, how should queue work? clientId adjustments...
- making seed randomisation work
- dungeon LCM needs to work, mode:4 is bypass
- dungeon lora finder, similar to ckpt finder
- click image to zoom / carousel function

## Future

- workflow switcher (dungeon, example2, etc)
  - alternative layouts abstraction
  - fastgen example?
- update system (and uib workflows) to work with comfy ui workflow v0.4
- debug prompt / workflow checkbox
- add air-bnb
- code tidy up, fix all prop-types, linting, uik-kit warnings, etc
- save current formData to LS
  - reset to defaults
- pwa?
- README redo, how to make UIB workflows
- github CI build process
- image input (for ipa)
- video input (for animatediff)
