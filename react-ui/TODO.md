# TODO

## Now

## Next

- loader spinner, interrupt and queue features
  - using multiple instances, how should queue work? clientId adjustments...
- making seed randomisation work
- dungeon LCM needs to work
- dungeon lora finder, similar to ckpt finder
- click image to zoom / carousel function

## Future

- add air-bnb
- code tidy up, fix all prop-types, linting, uik-kit warnings, etc
- save current formData to LS
  - reset to defaults
- workflow switcher (dungeon, example2, etc)
  - alternative layouts abstraction
  - fastgen example?
- pwa
- README redo, how to make UIB workflows
- github CI build process

## Ideas
