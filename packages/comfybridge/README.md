# @ui-builder/comfybridge

JS module for communicating with ComfyUI APIs and WS

## ideas

- connect to ws, finds one from a list
- gets object_info (all nodes info)
- gives prompt / prompt interrupt functions at same url as open websocket
- queue
- should export the comfy bridge context and react hook too

- ws mock
- endpoint mocks
